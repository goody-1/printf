## Introduction

"Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't."

This project aims to provide a basic understanding of implementing a custom `printf` function in C. The code handles various conversion specifiers, allowing you to print characters, strings, and integers to the standard output stream.

## Usage

To use the custom `printf` function, include the provided header file:

```
#include "main.h"
```
Call the function using the following prototype:

```
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

The function returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings. It writes output to the standard output stream (stdout).
